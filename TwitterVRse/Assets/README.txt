THANK YOU FOR YOUR PURCHASE

Infinity Engine is written using C# 7 syntax. This means that you must activate this option in Unity Editor.

If you don't do this, Unity will not compile your project.

To enable C# 7 syntax, go to https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-incremental-c-compiler.523993/

Then switch the target Scripting Runtime Version to .NET 4* in Player Settings
